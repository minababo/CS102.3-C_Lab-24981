This code example shows how to format and print different types of data using the printf() function in C. It uses format specifiers, like %i, %s, %d, %f, %x, and %o, to specify how the data should be displayed. By understanding these format specifiers and providing the appropriate arguments, you can control how the output appears. For example, you can print strings, integers in different number systems, floating point numbers with specific precision, and even special characters like '%'. Mastering format specifiers allows us to format and customize the output in C programs according to our needs.
